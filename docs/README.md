# chisel3/docs/README.md

This directory contains documentation on the code within this repository.
Documents can either be written directly in markdown, or
use embedded [mdoc](https://scalameta.org/mdoc/)
which compiles against the `chisel3` (and dependencies) codebase
as part of the PR CI checks,
forcing the documentation to remain current with the codebase.
The `src` folder contains the source from which these are generated.

For each topic, we categorize documentation as described in
[Divio's documentation system](https://documentation.divio.com/).

These directories contain 3 documentation types:
* Tutorials
* Explanation
* How-To Guides

Note that the 4th documentation type, "Reference", is omitted here.
We are working on generating API documentation from the code.
